description: 在Makati抽烟有以前属于指定吸烟区，现在不让抽了。有大概10个菲律宾人几个中国人在一起抽烟，结果来了一帮狗币没有穿制服的 自称是警察，直接很果断的说一人一千p 菲律宾人直接就走，我们一起走结果只拦截我们中国人，而菲律宾人一个都没有栏，直接让走了，说了半天听不懂的语言 又给我们拍照，我说请给我看下你的证件 结果他说，让我找另一个领头的要，结果领头的过来并没有给我们看他的证件  只是管我们要ID  很不公平的对待，真以为中国人是他们的提款机了，，禁止吸烟 那么请你不要卖烟，不知道各位大神有没有知道在哪里可以告这些压榨钱财的假警察？Smoking in Makati used to be a designated smoking area. Now it is not allowed to smoke. There are about 10 Filipinos of Chinese people who smoke together. As a result, a group of dog money without uniforms is called the police. It is directly and decisively that one person one thousand P Filipinos go directly. We walk together to intercept only our Chinese, and the Filipinos have no column, let go and say half a day. I would like to take a picture of us again. I said please show me your certificate. He said, let me find another leader. The result of the lead did not show us his documents. It's just that we want ID to be very unfair. I think the Chinese are their cash machines, and no smoking, so do not sell cigarettes, so please do not sell cigarettes, so stop smoking. I wonder if the great gods have any idea where they can tell these fake policemen who are squeezing money.
