China had set an example of an organ transplant model with trustworthy government involvement, he said.In 2011, China criminalized the unauthorized trading of organs, a crime for which the death penalty can be imposed in severe cases.From 2007 to 2017, a joint task force from China's top health and public security authorities arrested about 220 people including 60 medical staff, for their participation in organ trafficking.The task force rescued about 100 victims during the same period, according to data presented by the Chinese delegation at the meeting.It was the second time China was invited by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences to a meeting in the Holy See.Chinese scholars, including former Chinese vice minister of health Huang Jiefu, are confident such exchanges will enable people in China and the Vatican to know more about each other before diplomatic relations are established."These exchanged are based on concrete goals with the collaboration of the government. I think these exchanges will grow in the future at the academic and scientific level," PAS chancellor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo said in an email sent to the Global Times on Wednesday. "The role of China is becoming more and more important, not only in China but also in the influence that China can have all over the world, especially thanks to the One Belt One Road initiative," said Sorondo.Newspaper headline: China shares know-how at Vatican
